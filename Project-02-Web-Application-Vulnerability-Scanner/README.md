# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

A Python-based web application security scanner with an intuitive Flask web interface. This tool automates the process of scanning web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Designed for educational, testing, and demonstration purposes, it features modular code, customizable payloads, and detailed scan reports.

## Features

- **Automated Crawling:** Discovers forms and input fields on target web pages.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Tests for SQLi, XSS (reflected, DOM-based), and CSRF.
- **Custom Payloads:** Easily extend or modify payloads for advanced testing.
- **Scan Reporting:** Generates clear, timestamped scan reports with evidence.
- **User-Friendly Web UI:** Start scans and view results from your browser.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** Switch between dark and light modes for comfortable viewing.
